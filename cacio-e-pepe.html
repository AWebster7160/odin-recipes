    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><h3>Time: 30 minutes</h3></p>
    <p><h3>Yield: 4-6 Servings</h3></p>

    <p>A simple, yet indulgent, pasta dish using pantry ingredients. Pairs well with chicken and seafood mains.</p>

    <p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>16 oz pasta, customarily spaghetti, but whatever is on hand</li>
            <li>Parmigiano Reggiano, grated as finely as possible</li>
            <li>Pecorino Romano, grated as finely as possible</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Lemon juice</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a generously salted pot of water to a boil, and add chosen pasta. Cook ~1 min shy of al dente.</li>
            <li>In the last minute of cooking time reserve at least 1/2 cup of the cooking water. The starch will help bind the sauce</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta and return to the pot.</li>
            <li>Add butter and stir to melt. Working slowly, a small handfull at a time, add grated cheeses and continue to stir. Ensure cheese melts before adding more. This will help prevent clumping. Add ~1/4 cup of reserved starch water to bind cheese to pasta. Add more if needed.</li>
            <li>After all cheese has been incorporated, add black pepper.</li>
            <li>Squeeze lemon juice over servings and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
